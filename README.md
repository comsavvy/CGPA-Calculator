# ABOUT
                    
This is a $Program$ for `Calculating` the $Total CPGA$ of each Semester of a student.


# HOW IT WORKS
                    
1. It will first of all ask the student to enter both $Total Courses$ and $Total Unit$ for that **Semester**.

2. So through what the student filled for the total unit, the $Program$ will now begin to ask for both the `Course_(grade & unit)`

3. Once the $Program$ has reached the end, the $Program$ will gives both $GRADE$ and the $GRADE STATUS$ with $advice$ to the student.

4. The $Program$ will then ask the user, do you want to see the DataFrame of your Inputs? (The choice is in the hand of the User)

5. The progam is still going to ask if the user want to see the countplot of the Grade (The choice is in the hand of the User).

# CONCLUSION

And also, the $Programmer$ that build this $Program$ has built it in a way that the $Program$ will run smoothly. Once you type in unrequire value, the $Program$ will still allow you start again without re-running it.
