# ABOUT
*This is a program for `calculating`  the `Total CPGA` of each semester of a student.*
## HOW IT WORKS                    
1. It will firstly ask the student to enter both `Total Courses` and `Total Unit` for that semester.

2. So through what the student filled for the `total unit`, the program will now begin to ask for both the `Course_(grade & unit)`

3. Once the program has reached the end, the program will gives both GRADE and the `GRADE STATUS` with `Advice` to the student.

4. The Program will then ask the user, do you want to see the DataFrame of your Inputs? (The choice is in the hand of the User)

5. The progam is still going to ask if the user want to see the countplot of the Grade (The choice is in the hand of the User).

## CONCLUSION
*And also, the programmer that build this program has built it in a way that the program will run smoothly. Once you type in unrequire value, the program will still allow you start again without re-running it.*
